I've worked hard the last couple of weeks getting my new design out there and today is the day!

Building an online brand is hard work and needs too be considered carefully.
I've thought about this really long and carefully, did some couple of drafts in the past, but never was happy with the results.

Until now. I did hundreds of iterations on the design, and there are still some places that I'm not 100% happy about,
but I think it's time for getting your feedback!

But first let me talk real quick a little bit about the community.

## Community

Without all the private feedback I've got over the last couple of weeks, this would just not been possible.

That's why I **really love** working with the community.

> and of course our newest MVP [jjcolumb](https://github.com/jjcolumb)! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

But what does it mean to be part of a community?

I wrote about this [in the past](2019/12/05/the-third-annual-csharp-advent-pretzel-journey.html#community), but just a quick recap what it means working as an MVP in an open community and what *not*.

Back in the days I got voted as an MVP (I can't remember exactly when, @Dennis if you know, let me know in the comments below) I mainly did read the [supportcenter](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/) tickets related to [XAF](tags/XAF.html) and [XPO](tags/XPO.html) and try to learn more about the framework and eco system and tried to answer questions I know an solution to, as well as getting inspiration how to make our team more productive.

Also I tried to make the **hard** things *easier* by throwing out some [open source stuff](https://github.com/biohazard999?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=).  
To mention a few with more traction:

* [DXNugetPackageBuilder](https://github.com/biohazard999/DXNugetPackageBuilder)
* [FluentModelBuilder](https://github.com/biohazard999/Para.FluentModelBuilder)
* [DXImageAssemblyImporter](https://github.com/biohazard999/DXImageAssemblyImporter)
* [WindowsIntegration](https://github.com/biohazard999/Xpand.ExpressApp.Win.Para.WindowsIntegration) (this was the first one)

Some of them are obsolete now (`DXNugetPackageBuilder` is not longer needed, but for legacy apps it's still valuable).

I put a lot of effort and time into this in the past and I am always happy if I put something out there that helped *somebody else* and I will continue to do so.

This is the **giving** back to the community part.
But a community is not only about *giving* it's also about **taking**.

I do it every day. Using open source, reading blog-posts, articles, docs, samples, reaching out to people helping me to achieve **my goal**.

People are investing hundreds of thousands of hours into problem solving online.

* Write a blog post about a problem so I have a space to look at if I ever encounter this again
* Write a tutorial / in depth for reference
* Write open source software
* Contribute by
  * Comment
  * Fix spelling
  * Provide documentation
  * Testing
  * Filing bugs/issues/ideas
* Provide funding

The last point is interesting, cause we all know that we need money for living, but let me focus know on parts that I don't think are part of an open community:

* Spam
* Being rude
* Try to get support for free
* Be upset cause somebody of the community does not respond quick enough / at all
